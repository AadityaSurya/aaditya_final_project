<h1>Aaditya Surya - Columbia Big Data and Machine Learning - Final Project</h1>
<h2>This is the walkthrough of my final project for my Columbia Big Data and Machine Learning class.</h2>
<h3>Project Proposal</h3>
<p>For my final project, I have been looking into stock analysis and predictions. This is as recently I have grown a liking towards investments and stock analysis and hence I want to use this newfound interest within R. Further, I want to be able to use my project in the future, and as I am interested in stocks, I believe that this program may be of use to me in the future.</p>
