<h1>Aaditya Surya - Columbia Big Data and Machine Learning - Final Project</h1>
<h2>This is the walkthrough of my final project for my Columbia Big Data and Machine Learning class.</h2>

<h3>Project Proposal</h3>
<p>For my final project, I have been looking into stock analysis and predictions. This is as recently I have grown a liking towards investments and stock analysis and hence I want to use this newfound interest within R. Further, I want to be able to use my project in the future, and as I am interested in stocks, I believe that this program may be of use to me in the future.</p>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>My final project is a rudimentary analysis of Cryptocurrencies through R. I want to be able to do all the basic analysis of cryptocurrency, be able to set out time series and plot moving averages and other aspects that can assist my data analysis. Being a beginner at R, I also want to expand my knowledge using the "Shiny web app" features of R.</p>

<p>The above repository contains two main files labelled Crypto Shiny Test and Basic EDA. The Basic EDA is a simple data analysis using crypto of many cryptocurrencies. Further, the Crypto Shiny Test is a Shiny App that allows one to see a time series plot of BTC, ETH and DOT.</p>
